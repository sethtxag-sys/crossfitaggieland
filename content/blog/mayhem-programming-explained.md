# Mayhem Programming Explained: The System Behind CrossFit Aggieland

If you've looked around the CrossFit community, you've probably heard people talk about different programming. Some gyms do their own thing. Some follow linear programs. Some just throw random workouts at the wall and see what sticks.

At [CrossFit Aggieland](/), we use Mayhem programming. I want to tell you what that means, why we chose it, and what it actually delivers to our members.

## What is Mayhem?

Mayhem is a structured fitness program created by Rich Froning and his team. Rich Froning is a four-time CrossFit Games champion. He's one of the most accomplished athletes in the sport. When he designed Mayhem, he wasn't trying to create a generic fitness program. He was designing a system that works.

Mayhem isn't random. It's not "let's see what sounds fun today." It's a periodized program that builds on itself. That means there's a structure. There's progression. There's purpose behind every workout.

The program focuses on three main pillars: strength, power, and metabolic conditioning. Not all in equal measures every single day. The balance shifts based on what block of training you're in. Some weeks, you're building raw strength. Some weeks, you're developing power and speed. Some weeks, you're building your capacity to work hard for long periods.

This matters because your body doesn't improve the same way for all these qualities. You can't maximize strength and conditioning in the exact same workout. Mayhem understands this and structures the programming accordingly.

## Why Random WODs Don't Work as Well

Let me be honest about something. A lot of gyms just program random workouts of the day. It looks like this: coach comes in, writes some movements on the board, tells everyone to go hard, people leave feeling tired.

That's not strategy. That's just fatigue.

Here's what happens when you do random workouts. You feel like you're working hard, so you think you're making progress. Some days you're good at the movements, some days you're not. You might get stronger, but it's pretty random. You might plateau for months because there's no structure to push you past that plateau.

Compare that to structured programming. With Mayhem, you're building toward something specific. If you're in a strength block, the weights get progressively heavier. Your body adapts. Your nervous system learns to handle more load. You get measurably stronger.

Then you enter a power block. You're doing explosive movements with good weights. You're training your body to move faster. That's a different adaptation.

Then conditioning. You're doing longer workouts, shorter rest, moving for extended periods. Your aerobic capacity improves. Your ability to recover between efforts improves.

The point is this: with random WODs, you're just guessing. With Mayhem, you're systematically improving every quality you need to be a complete athlete.

## How We Use Mayhem at CFA

We follow the Mayhem programming pretty strictly here at CrossFit Aggieland. That means everyone at our gym is doing the same general workout each day, with scaling for individual fitness levels.

Our newest member does the same workout as someone who's been training for five years. The difference is the weight on the bar, the range of motion, the intensity level. The stimulus is the same. The progression is structured.

This creates a few benefits:

First, community. Everyone's working on the same thing. You can watch more experienced members and see what you're building toward. You can help newer members understand the movements. You're all in it together.

Second, coaching efficiency. Our coaches know exactly what we're trying to accomplish that day. They can cue better. They can push you to the right level. They can scale with purpose, not just make things easier.

Third, accountability. You can actually measure progress. If we did the same workout three months ago and you lifted 135 pounds, and today you lifted 155 pounds, you got stronger. That's not a feeling. That's data.

## The Blocks and How They Build

Mayhem programming moves in blocks. Let me walk you through what a typical cycle looks like.

You start with a strength block. Could be four weeks, could be six. During this time, you're doing compound barbell movements multiple times a week. Back squat. Bench press. Deadlift. Front squat. You're building the foundation. The weights progressively increase. Your body learns to handle load.

Then you move into a power block. This is where you take that strength and express it fast. You're doing Olympic lifting variations, jumping, explosive movements. You're not as heavy as the strength block, but you're moving fast. This block teaches your nervous system to generate force quickly.

Then a conditioning block. Now you're taking what you built and applying it to longer efforts, higher rep counts, faster pacing. You're building your capacity to sustain effort.

Then usually a mix block where you're touching all three qualities, preparing your body for whatever comes next.

The beauty of this is that each block prepares you for the next one. Your body isn't just tired. It's systematically becoming a more capable machine.

## What This Means for You

If you join CrossFit Aggieland, here's what you're getting:

A program designed by an athlete who understands what it takes to be fit. Not a guessing game. Not a random workout generator. Actual strategy.

Progressive overload. Each week builds on the last. You're tracking your progress. You can see yourself getting stronger, faster, more capable.

Balanced development. You're not just getting good at one thing. You're becoming a well-rounded athlete. Strong. Explosive. Durable. Good at sustained effort.

Community approach. Everyone's following the same program, which builds camaraderie and makes coaching more effective.

## How Long Does It Take to See Results?

This is the real question. People want to know if this actually works.

With consistent training on Mayhem programming, most people see noticeable strength improvements within four to six weeks. Your nervous system is learning. Your body is adapting. You're lifting heavier weights. That's measurable.

In 12 weeks, the changes are pretty obvious. You feel stronger in daily life. You have more energy. You're probably sleeping better. You feel more capable.

By six months, if you've been consistent, you're a genuinely different athlete than you were when you started. Your strength has increased. Your conditioning has improved. Your confidence is higher because you've proven something to yourself.

## The Results at CrossFit Aggieland

We've been using Mayhem programming for years at CFA. We've won Best of the Brazos 13 times since 2013. That's not because we got lucky. That's because our members consistently show up, follow the programming, and get results.

We've got members who've transformed their bodies. Members who went from not being able to do a pull-up to knocking out multiple unbroken. Members who deadlifted 185 pounds for the first time in their lives. Members who ran a 5K for the first time in years. Members who just feel stronger in how they move through their day.

And we've got all of this because we use a system that works. Mayhem isn't flashy. It's not going to give you a crazy pump or make you feel destroyed after one workout. But it will make you measurably stronger and more fit over time. That's what matters.

## Getting Started with Mayhem

You don't have to understand all of this to benefit from it. You just have to show up and follow what the coach tells you to do.

Our [eight coaches at CFA](/coaches) are trained in Mayhem programming. They understand the blocks. They understand the progression. They can scale it for wherever you are. Completely new to fitness? They've got you. Coming back from time off? They'll adjust. Already strong? They'll push you.

We offer a [free first week](/), so you can experience the programming without any commitment. Come to a class. Feel what structured programming is like. Meet our coaches and community.

[Check our schedule](/schedule) to find a time that works for you. We're open from 5 AM to 7:30 PM on weekdays and Saturday mornings.

And if cost is a concern, we offer [various discounts for teachers, military, law enforcement, and veterans](/pricing). We believe in supporting the people who support the community.

## The Bottom Line

Mayhem programming works because it's based on proven training principles. Progressive overload. Periodization. Balanced development. Consistency.

You don't become strong by accident. You don't become fit by guessing. You become better by following a system and showing up consistently.

That's what we offer at CrossFit Aggieland.
