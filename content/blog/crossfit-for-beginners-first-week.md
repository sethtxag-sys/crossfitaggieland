# CrossFit for Beginners: What to Expect Your First Week

You've decided to try CrossFit. Maybe you've been thinking about it for months. Maybe you saw someone training and thought, "I want to do that." Either way, you're nervous. What will it be like? Will you be the only beginner? Will you embarrass yourself? Will you be sore for a month?

Let me walk you through your first week at CrossFit Aggieland step by step. This is real—based on training hundreds of people who walked in nervous and unsure, just like you.

## Before You Come In

You don't need anything special. Don't buy expensive shoes. Don't buy a fancy gym bag. Wear clothes you can move in. Bring water. That's it.

You probably have questions about what movements are called, what scaling means, what you're supposed to do. That's fine. Your coach will explain everything. That's literally their job.

Come slightly early to your first class (we'll say 5 minutes) so your coach can do a quick assessment. They'll ask:

- Have you trained before? (CrossFit or otherwise)
- Any old injuries or limitations?
- What brought you here?

This isn't an interrogation. It's so they know how to scale your workout. If you had shoulder surgery three years ago, your coach needs to know that. If you hate running, good to know. They adjust based on this information.

## Day 1: You Walk In and Everything Feels Unfamiliar

You're in the gym. It looks different than a traditional gym—maybe one or two barbells at each station, bumper plates, rowers, a whiteboard with today's workout scrawled on it. People are warming up, joking around, moving weight that looks heavy to you.

Your coach gathers everyone and explains the workout. Let's say today is:

*Warm-up: 200m run, then 5 reps each of air squats, push-ups, pull-ups*

*Strength: Back squats, 5 reps at 65%, 5 at 75%, 3 at 85%*

*Conditioning: For 12 minutes, AMRAP (as many rounds as possible): 6 deadlifts, 9 calories on rower*

You have no idea what 65% means. You don't know your 1-rep max back squat. This is fine.

Your coach will ask, "How much have you lifted before?" You say, "Never," or "A little," and they assign you a starting weight. It's usually lighter than you think you should do. Don't let pride override common sense. You can always add weight next week.

During the warm-up, you're moving. Your body feels good. The movements are simple and you can do them.

During strength, you're focused. Your coach watches your form closely. They might say, "Depth's not quite there" or "Good, that looked solid." It's feedback, not judgment. You do your sets. You're not moving super heavy weight, but you're lifting.

During the conditioning piece, it's 12 minutes of work. You're getting moving. You might be breathing hard by round 2. You finish. You're tired, not destroyed. You realize you can do this.

**How you feel:** Pumped. Nervous but accomplished. A little sore in your legs already.

## Day 2: Muscle Soreness Shows Up Hard

Welcome to DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness). Your legs hurt. Your shoulders might be sore. Stairs suck.

This is 100% normal. This doesn't mean CrossFit was too hard. It means your body trained. The soreness peaks today and tomorrow, then gets better.

You probably think, "Maybe I shouldn't go back today." You should. Moving helps recovery. The soreness goes away faster if you train than if you sit on the couch. Plus, your coach will scale today's workout appropriately.

Let's say today's workout is:

*Warm-up: 500m row, mobility work*

*Skill: Dumbbell snatches, learning the movement*

*WOD: 3 rounds of 8 dumbbell snatches, 12 box step-ups, 400m run*

Your legs are sore. You might be tempted to skip the box step-ups. Your coach will probably suggest: "Do step-ups instead of box jumps today, that'll feel better with sore legs." Or maybe: "Box step-ups at a lower height if you need it."

The movement is different from yesterday. Your brain is engaged learning the dumbbell snatch. Your legs are working even though they're sore. By the end of the workout, your soreness actually feels slightly better.

**How you feel:** Sore but not broken. Proud you came back. Realizing the soreness isn't as bad as you feared once you move.

## Day 3: You Find Your Rhythm

Your soreness is peaking or just past peak. You feel stronger today than yesterday. Your body is adapting.

You're starting to understand the pattern. Warm-up, then skill work or strength, then conditioning. Your coach explains it as: "We're building a strong body, learning techniques, and building conditioning. Every day has all three."

That makes sense. You're not just going hard—there's a logic to the training.

Today might be a gymnastics day:

*Warm-up: 1000m row, shoulder mobility, air squats*

*Strength: Bench press, 5-5-3 rep scheme*

*Conditioning: 20 minute AMRAP: 2 wall walks, 4 push-ups, 6 air squats*

Wall walks are new. You've never done them. Your coach shows you: place hands on ground, walk feet up the wall, do a push-up, walk back down. You try. They look easy until you actually do them. Your core is shaking.

You notice other people in class scaling too. One person is doing negative push-ups (coach helping them down). Someone else is doing incline push-ups on a bench. You're not special in needing modification—it's just training smart.

By the end of the workout, you've done 20 minutes of movement. You're tired. You're also feeling capable.

**How you feel:** Getting stronger. Less sore. You notice your body moving better. You're not dreading coming back tomorrow.

## Day 4: Familiarity Kills the Nervousness

Day 4 and you're a gym regular now. You know where to put your stuff. You know your coach's name. You know a couple other people who train at this time.

You understand what a WOD is. You understand scaling. You understand that your job is to work hard at your level, not compare yourself to the person next to you doing more weight or moving faster.

Today's workout might be a longer conditioning piece:

*Warm-up: 500m row, 10 arm circles each direction, 10 leg swings each leg, 5 inch worms*

*Strength: Front squats, working up to a heavy triple (3 reps)*

*Conditioning: 15 minute AMRAP: 5 power cleans, 10 ring rows, 15 wall balls*

You've done front squats before (well, twice). You still feel shaky on the movement, but less shaky. Your coach watches closely. "Chest up more," they say. You adjust.

During the conditioning, you're moving steadily. You know you're not supposed to go all out immediately—that's how people hurt themselves. You pace it. By minute 10 you're working harder. By minute 15 you're exhausted but you finished strong.

**How you feel:** Like you belong here. Your body is sore (less than day 2) but also strong. You're sleeping well. You're hungry. These are all good signs.

## Day 5-6: You Can Feel Real Adaptation

By day 5 or 6 of your free week, something shifts. You walk in and you're not nervous. You're almost confident. Your body responds faster. The movements feel less alien.

You notice little things:

- You recovered better from yesterday's workout
- You have more energy in the second half of today's workout
- Your form looks a little cleaner
- You did something today you couldn't do on day 1

These are real adaptations happening in your body. You've trained 5-6 times in a week. Your nervous system adapted. Your muscles adapted. Your aerobic capacity went up slightly.

Today might be a mixed modal day:

*Warm-up: 800m run, joint mobility, 2 sets of 5 Romanian deadlifts*

*Strength: Deadlifts, 5 reps at 60%, 5 at 70%, 5 at 80%*

*Conditioning: 5 rounds for time: 10 deadlifts, 200m run, 5 burpees*

The deadlift is a movement that clicked for you. Your back feels strong. Your coach says, "That looked textbook." You feel legitimately proud.

The conditioning is 5 rounds. On day 1, you might have thought 5 rounds sounded impossible. Now you know it's doable. You pace it. You finish. You're tired but satisfied.

**How you feel:** Genuinely strong. Noticeably fitter than when you walked in Monday. You've got energy. Your sleep is deep. You're thinking about what comes after day 7.

## Day 7: The Decision

You've done your free week. Seven days of training. You've learned about scaling. You've met coaches and other members. You've experienced DOMS and adaptation. You know what this actually is, not what you imagined it was.

Most people decide to stay.

Some people realize CrossFit isn't for them, and that's fine. Better to know after a free week than sign a contract and regret it. But most people feel the difference. They feel stronger. They sleep better. They have a community. They want more.

## A Note on Soreness and Real Pain

During your first week, you'll probably be sore. Sore is normal and goes away.

Pain is different. Sharp pain, shooting pain, pain that doesn't go away—tell your coach immediately. Stop the movement. This is what they're trained for. Soreness isn't injury. Pain is your body saying something's wrong.

Good coaches notice when you're limping or compensating. They'll ask, "How's your knee?" If you say it's a little tight, they adjust your workout. That's what good coaching looks like.

## The Real First Week Experience

Your first week at CrossFit Aggieland isn't going to be what you imagined. It might be easier (you can do more than you thought). It might be harder (the conditioning is rougher than expected). It will definitely be different.

But you'll also feel something real. Your body getting stronger. Your mind getting clearer. A community of people working toward the same thing.

That feeling is why people stay. That's why we've been in College Station since 2013. That's why members come back for years.
