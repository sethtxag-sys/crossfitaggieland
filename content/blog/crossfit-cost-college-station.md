# How Much Does CrossFit Cost in College Station? A Real Breakdown

Let's talk money. I know you're looking at different gyms in the Brazos Valley and trying to figure out if CrossFit is worth the cost. I'm going to be straight with you about what you pay, what you get, and why it's actually a good deal.

## The Price at CrossFit Aggieland

First, the numbers. At [CrossFit Aggieland](/), located at 3815 General Parkway in College Station, we have tiered [pricing options](/pricing).

Our pricing structure is designed to fit different budgets and commitment levels. You can come as many times as you want per month. You can take classes at any time we're open, from 5 AM to 7:30 PM, on weekdays and Saturday mornings. There's no contract. You can stop whenever you want.

We also offer discounts. If you're a student at Texas A&M, you get a discount. If you're active military, veteran, teacher, or law enforcement, you get a discount. We believe in supporting people who support the community.

And you can try it for free. First week is on us, no credit card, no commitment. You can experience what we're about before you spend a dime.

## What You're Actually Paying For

Here's what people get wrong about CrossFit pricing. They look at the monthly cost and compare it to a big box gym where membership is like 30 bucks a month.

That's comparing a car to a boat because they're both vehicles.

When you join CrossFit Aggieland, you're not just getting access to a gym. You're getting:

Professional coaching. Every single class is led by a real coach who knows how to teach the movements, scale the workout for your fitness level, and push you to your potential. We have eight coaches. They're good at what they do.

Intelligent programming. You're not doing random workouts. You're following [Mayhem programming](/blog/mayhem-programming-explained), which is built by actual world-class athletes. The programming progresses. It builds on itself. You get systematically stronger.

Community. You're not working out alone in a room full of strangers. You're part of a group that's trying to get better together. This matters more than people think for consistency and results.

A plan. You show up, the coach tells you what to do, you do it. No decision fatigue. No wondering if you're doing the right thing.

The difference between CrossFit and a big box gym is the difference between going to culinary school and buying an easy bake oven. Both produce food. One is actually going to teach you.

## Cost Per Class

Let's break this down per class to see if the value makes sense.

If you train 12 times per month (about three times per week), let's say your membership is $X per month. That's less than $Y per class.

Compare that to a personal trainer at a traditional gym. A single hour with a trainer is usually $60 to $120. That's just one person coaching you. At CrossFit Aggieland, you're getting coached, you've got a group keeping you accountable, and the per-class cost is lower.

If you're coming four or five times per week, the per-class cost drops even more. You could be looking at less than $Z per class at that point.

And here's the thing that matters: when you have structure, coaching, and community, you actually stick with it. Most people who pay $30 a month for a big box gym go like three times and stop. They've spent money but they haven't gotten results.

When you're paying for real coaching and you've got people expecting you to show up, you actually train. You get results. That changes the ROI calculation significantly.

## The Contract Question

A lot of gyms trap you in year-long contracts. You sign up, you come for three months, you get busy, you keep paying for six months while you don't go.

We don't do that here. If you want to stop, you stop. No contract. This is actually a sign of confidence in what we offer. We know if you train consistently, you'll see results and you'll want to stay.

## The Discount Options

If cost is a real factor for you, we have discounts that might help.

Students at Texas A&M get a discount. Your education is being paid for by someone, and we respect that. We want to support your fitness while you're building your future.

Veterans get a discount. Active military gets a discount. Teachers get a discount. Law enforcement get a discount. These are people who we believe deserve support. If you fall into one of these categories, talk to us about what your real cost would be.

## What Other Gyms Cost

Let me put this in perspective. What does fitness actually cost in College Station?

A basic gym membership at a big box gym is like 30 to 50 bucks per month. But you're coaching yourself. You're programming yourself. You don't have a plan. Most people quit.

A personal trainer can run $75 to $150 per session. So if you're seeing someone twice a week, you're looking at $600 to $1,200 per month. That's a lot of money.

CrossFit is somewhere in the middle. You're getting professional coaching and community at a price that's sustainable for most people.

The other thing to consider is opportunity cost. If you're out of shape, that costs you. You get sick more often. You have lower energy. You're less productive at work. You're less present with your family. A membership that helps you get fit is actually an investment in preventing those costs.

## Transparent Pricing

I want to be clear about one thing: I could hide our pricing behind a form where you have to give us your email and phone number to see the cost. A lot of gyms do that.

We don't. Our [pricing is on our website](/pricing). You can see exactly what it costs without having to talk to anyone. If it fits your budget, great. If it doesn't right now, maybe it will later.

## The Real Question

The real question isn't "how much does CrossFit cost?" The question is "what are the results worth to you?"

If you train consistently at CrossFit Aggieland for six months, you're going to be noticeably stronger and more fit. Your confidence is going to improve. Your energy levels are going to be better. You're going to sleep better. You're going to have relationships with people who are invested in your success.

Is that worth the cost? For most people, yes. Absolutely.

## Making the Decision

Here's what I suggest. Come in for your [free first week](/start). Try it out. Talk to our coaches about your goals and your budget. See if this fits your life and your wallet.

We offer [various membership options](/pricing) to fit different needs. Some people do unlimited classes. Some people do four classes per month. Some people do a drop-in rate and just come when they can.

You can also ask about our discounts. If you're in education, military, law enforcement, or you're a student, we probably have something that works better for your budget.

The point is this: fitness is not a luxury. It's a health investment. The question isn't whether you can afford it. It's whether you can afford not to.

And at CrossFit Aggieland, we've made it as accessible as we can while still providing the quality coaching and programming that actually get results.
